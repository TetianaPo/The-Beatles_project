              The Beatles were an English four-piece rock band, formed in
              Liverpool in 1960. The members of the band were John Lennon, Paul
              McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, with John and Ringo
              playing the guitar, Paul on bass guitar and Ringo on the drums. In
              March 1956, John Lennon, aged 16, and a few of his friends from
              school played in a skiffle band called the Quarrymen. After
              meeting John in the July of that year, Paul McCartney joined the
              band as a rhythm guitarist and invited his friend George Harrison
              to watch the band perform. George then auditioned to be in the
              band, but John thought that he was too young, however, after
              several months of persistence, he performed lead guitar in a
              performance as was enlisted as their lead guitarist. By January
              1959, John’s friends from school had left, and he began studying
              at Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, John, Paul and
              George, were playing under the name Johnny and the Moondogs, and
              playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Stuart
              Sutcliffe, an art college friend of John and band member,
              suggested that the band name should be Beatals, as a tribute to
              Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May of
              1959, where they went to the Silver Beetles, the Silver Beatles
              and then in August, shortened to simply The Beatles.

            <p>
              During one of their performances at The Cavern Club, they met
              Brian Epstein – a local store owner and music columnist. He became
              their manager in 1962, after courting them for a couple of months.
              Brian eventually released the band from contractual obligations in
              Hamburg a month early in exchange for a recording session. In
              April, the band was met with horrific news: Sutcliffe had died
              suddenly from a brain haemorrhage. Three months later, Brian
              negotiated a deal with George Martin, the owner of EMI’s
              Parlophone label. Their first recording session with George Martin
              took place on 6th June 1962, at EMI’s Abbey Road Studios. Martin
              immediately complained about Best’s drumming ability, and
              suggested a session drummer in his place. The band was already
              considering dismissing Best, and therefore hired Ringo Starr in
              August 1962. Starr left his band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes,
              to join them. During their third session with Martin, The Beatles
              recorded Love Me Do, Please Please Me and P.S. I Love You with
              Starr on the drums, but George was dissatisfied and got Andy
              White, a session drummer, to take Ringo’s place in the song, with
              Ringo on the tambourine. Love Me Do was released, and peaked at
              number 17 on the Record Retailer chart. Martin suggested that
              Please Please Me should be a faster tempo, and recording took
              place in November. Martin accurately predicted “you’ve just made
              your first number one.” In 1963, the band decided that all four
              members should contribute vocals to their albums, despite Starr’s
              limited vocal range. As Lennon and McCarthy established a
              songwriting partnership, it meant that it limited Harrison’s
              opportunities as lead vocalist. George Martin suggested that, if
              they were to be a success, they should change their ways – stop
              eating, swearing and smoking on stage.

            <h1>Beatlemania</h1>
            <p>
              On 11th February 1963, The Beatles recorded ten songs during a
              single studio session for their debut album, Please Please Me.
              After the positive reaction to their first single Love Me Do, the
              single Please Please Me was met with a bigger reaction, and
              reached number one on every UK chart except Record Retailer, where
              it reached number two. After a 5-day tour in Sweden, the band was
              met by hundreds of screaming fans and around 100 journalists and
              photographers. Due to the fans, police had to resort to using
              high-pressure water hoses at a concert in Plymouth. Please Please
              Me maintained at the top of the charts for 30 weeks, to be
              displaced with its follow up, With the Beatles. In 1964, The
              Beatles made their US debut on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9th
              February 1964 – where around 74 million viewers (around half of
              the US population) watched the performance. The Beatles’ songs
              filled the top 5 places on the American Top 40 chart, a feat which
              has, to this day, never been matched. The band stopped touring in
              1966 as they were getting tired of the audience screaming so
              loudly that the music couldn’t be heard. It marked the end of four
              years of non-stop touring, and a total of 1,400 appearances
              internationally.

            <p>
              After tensions between the band members grew after disagreements
              over who would manage their finances, on 20th September 1969,
              Lennon announced that he would leave the band. It was agreed that
              he would withhold an announcement to the public, avoiding the
              potential drop in sales of their upcoming album. This important
              event is documented in our 1969 timeline, joined with other iconic
              moments that happened in that year. Abbey Road was released on
              26th September and sold more than four million copies within three
              months – it also topped the UK charts for seventeen weeks in
              total. On the 31st December 1970, Paul McCartney filed for the
              dissolution of the Beatles’ contractual partnership. It was met
              with legal difficulties and it was not formalised until 29th
              December 1974, where John Lennon signed the paperwork whilst on
              holiday with his family at Walt Disney World Resort, in Florida.
