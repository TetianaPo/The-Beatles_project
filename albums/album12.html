          The final Beatles album was first released on 8th May, 1970, just
          prior to the launch of the cinema film of the same name. Rehearsals
          and recording sessions for the album had taken place in January, 1969
          first At Twickenham Film Studios and later in the basement and on the
          roof of their Apple headquarters in London's Savile Row. A single
          comprising of "Get Back" and "Don't Let Me Down" was released in
          April, 1969 but as The Beatles focussed their energies on a new album
          mainly recorded at Abbey Road, The "Get Back" album as it was then
          called remained unreleased.Once Abbey Road had been issued and the
          completion of the documentary film now imminent, it was noticed that
          rehearsals of George's song "I Me Mine" featured prominently in the
          film but had not been recorded in the studio. This was remedied on 3rd
          January, 1970 when George, Paul and Ringo performed it without John
          who was in Denmark. A second single from the album, which was now
          titled Let It Be appeared on 6th March. Up to now the idea behind the
          album had been to capture the group "live in the studio" without
          overdubs or effects but this changed when producer, Phil Spector was
          brought in to re-produce the tracks. The Long And Winding Road, which
          had been given a new musical arrangement featuring orchestra and
          choir, was released as a single in the US and other markets but not
          the UK and became the group's final # 1 single. The album reached no.
          1 for a three week stay during its 59 week chart stay. In the US, the
          album enjoyed a four week stay at #1 during an initial chart life of
          55 weeks.
