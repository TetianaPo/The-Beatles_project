          Beatles For Sale was released on 4th December, 1964 - just 21 weeks
          after A Hard Day's Night. It was The Beatles’ fourth album release in
          less than two years. The album had been recorded in seven days,
          scattered between August and October, when the band’s schedule was
          crammed with stage performances in the UK, Canada and the US, as well
          as radio and television work. Given the lack of time, it was not
          surprising that the group reverted to the 1963 formula of eight
          original songs and six covers.No single was released in the UK from
          Beatles For Sale - the non-album tracks "I Feel Fine" and "She's A
          Woman" performed that role - however, that coupling was followed-up in
          the US by "Eight Day's A Week" (b/w " I Don't Want To Spoil The
          Party") which became their 7th #1 in March 1965. The cover portraits -
          again taken by Robert Freeman - adorned an unusual gate-fold package
          with the pocket (containing the disc) only revealed once the album
          sleeve was opened. There was a new author for the cover notes, too -
          Derek Taylor. Check out the prophetic nature of his notes penned in
          the autumn of 1964! The album hit the UK number one spot and retained
          that position for eleven of the 46 weeks that it spent in the Top
          Twenty.Again, Beatles For Sale did not surface as a regular album in
          the US until 1987. In its place was "Beatles '65" which featured eight
          songs from Beatles For Sale, plus the A and B-side of 'I Feel Fine'
          and 'I'll Be Back' from the UK 's 'A Hard Day's Night' album. This
          album enjoyed a nine week run at the top of the US charts beginning in
          January, 1965. The remaining tracks from Beatles For Sale appeared on
          a later Capitol release 'Beatles VI' released in June, 1965. This too
          made the #1 position, which it held for six weeks.
