        <p>
          Released on 1st June, 1967, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the
          band's eighth album became the soundtrack to the "summer of love" but
          its appeal is timeless. Work had begun on the recording in late 1966
          and at one stage it was thought that both Penny Lane and Strawberry
          Fields Forever would also be included but when these were released as
          a single in February, that idea was abandoned. Revolver had only just
          been completed in time prior to the band flying off on yet another
          tour. Now that touring was behind them more time could be spent
          writing and recording. Between November 1966 and April, 1967, they
          spent over 400 hours in the studio - a far cry from the Please Please
          Me days. Of course the music was more complex and now that touring was
          over, there was no need to consider what could be reproduced in front
          of a live audience. In the studio The Beatles encouraged George Martin
          to achieve "the impossible" and in turn, George and the engineers
          would find innovative ways of realising this despite still using only
          four-track equipment. For the fourth time in the UK, no single was
          lifted from the album and this also held true in the US. The album was
          also not banded, encouraging the listener to play it all the way
          through, pausing only to turn the disc over. Not only was the music
          different, exciting and colourful so too was the way it was delivered.
          The glossy double wallet featured the guys in their Pepper uniforms
          surrounded by images of people they either admired or were interested
          in whilst on the back of the sleeve there were the lyrics to all the
          songs. Inside each side of the wallet were other surprises, a card
          featuring various cut-outs and in the initial pressings at least, the
          paper inner sleeve bore a psychedelic design. In the Britain the album
          hit number #1 and between June, 1967 and February, 1968 spent a total
          of 27 weeks at the top during an initial chart run of 148 weeks. All
          of this, in spite of a BBC ban on "A Day In The Life". In the US, the
          album was released in exactly same way as in Britainâ€¦ well almost. The
          high-pitched tone and the garbled speech embedded in the UK run-out
          groove did not appear on the American release. The album enjoyed a
          fifteen week stay at the top of the US Top 200 albums during its
          initial chart run of 88 weeks.
