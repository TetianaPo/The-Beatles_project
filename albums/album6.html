          Rubber Soul was another album for Christmas - released on 3rd
          December, 1965 just two weeks after final mixing had taken place.
          Following the release of their previous album The Beatles had
          undertaken a momentous tour of the USA and Canada including a record
          breaking appearance at New York's famous Shea Stadium. Following a
          deserved holiday, the guys returned to the studios in mid October, not
          only to record the album but also a new single - their first double
          A-side featuring "Day Tripper" and "We Can Work It Out".The album
          consisted of eleven songs by John and Paul, two by George and another
          with the unique writing credit of Lennon-McCartney-Starkey. The
          inclusion of a sitar on the song Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)
          also illustrated George's growing interest in Indian music and
          culture.Rubber Soul was also the last Beatles album for which Norman
          Smith manned the control desk. He took his leave after six albums and
          eleven singles going on to produce Pink Floyd and later still to enjoy
          success as 'Hurricane' Smith. The front cover photograph of Rubber
          Soul was again taken by Robert Freeman but the way the faces appear
          slightly distorted on the sleeve was a result on a happy accident
          while the image was being projected. It is also interesting to note
          that the group's name is absent from the front of the sleeve. The
          album spent nine weeks at the album chart summit in the UK during a
          healthy 43 chart stay.
