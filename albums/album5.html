          Released on 6th August, 1965, and eight months after Beatles For Sale,
          the recordings for Help! had actually started in earnest in mid
          February just one month after the guys had completed a season of
          'Another Beatles Christmas Show' at London's Hammersmith Odeon. Within
          days of the final February session, they were off to the Bahamas to
          film scenes for the movie, which like 'A Hard Day's Night' was
          directed by Richard Lester. From the Bahamas, The Beatles headed East
          to Obertauern, in Austria before heading back to the UK for more
          filming. A new single, 'Ticket To Ride' was released on 9th April and
          this needed to be promoted so various TV performances took place from
          the end of March to mid April along with an appearance at NME
          Poll-winners concert. All of these taking place either side of more
          filming which continued on and off until the middle of June by which
          time The Beatles had returned to Abbey Road to complete the material
          for the non-soundtrack side of the forthcoming album. On the 12th
          June, 1965 it was announced that The Beatles had been awarded MBE's in
          the Queen's birthday honours list - an accolade previously never given
          to young pop stars. Like A Hard Day's Night, Help! contained the songs
          from the film on side one of the album with the other side devoted to
          other new recordings including two covers. Unlike A Hard Day's Night,
          the two singles released prior to and alongside the album had
          exclusive B-sides. Help! also marked the return of George Harrison as
          a songwriter. George contributed one song to each side of the album.
          The striking album front cover features The Beatles making semaphore
          signals but these do not spell Help! The album went immediately to
          no.1 in the British charts remaining there for a total of nine of its
          37 weeks in the Top Twenty.
