          The Beatles' Please Please Me album was rush-released by Parlophone on
          22nd March, 1963 to capitalise on the enormous success of the title
          track which had been the group's second single and their first no. 1
          in the majority of UK charts. Ten of the album's fourteen tracks were
          recorded in just one day - 11th February, 1963. These included a
          mixture of stage favourites and "Lennon-McCartney originals". The four
          remaining songs had been committed to tape in 1962 having formed the
          B-side of their debut release and both sides of their second single. A
          slightly later recording of 'Love Me Do' to that previously released,
          was selected for the album. This version would also appear on a
          subsequent EP and later still on an American # 1 single in 1964. The
          iconic front cover shot was taken at the then headquarters of EMI
          Limited at 20 Manchester Square in London's West End in early 1963 by
          Angus McBean. EMI remained in the building until 1995 before moving to
          West London taking the famous balcony railing with them. Given that
          the UK album chart in those days tended to be dominated by more
          'adult' tastes such as film soundtracks and easy listening vocalists,
          it was a surprise when Please Please Me hit the top of the chart in
          May 1963 and remained there for thirty weeks before being replaced by
          With The Beatles. Please Please Me didn't receive an official US
          release until 1987 but "Introducing The Beatles" issued early in 1964
          on the Vee-Jay label and "The Early Beatles" released by Capitol
          Records the following year later did contain many of the songs from
          the British release.
