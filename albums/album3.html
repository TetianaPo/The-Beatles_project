          Released on 10th July, 1964, the Beatles third album in less than
          eighteen months was timed to coincide with the cinema opening of their
          first movie. Of the album's 13 tracks seven were featured in the
          soundtrack of the film. One single had been released ahead of the
          album that being "Can't Buy Me Love"/"You Can't Do That" which had
          been issued on 20thMarch. It was also quite remarkable that for the
          first time on a Beatles album that all of the titles had been composed
          by John and Paul. Since the release of With The Beatles, the previous
          November, their UK success had started to spread around the world.
          Their first US single via Capitol Records - "I Want To Hold Your
          Hand"/"I Saw Her Standing There" had topped the US charts for seven
          weeks, leading to their former US distributor reissuing 'She Loves
          You' and 'Love Me Do' both of which also reached the # 1 spot. In fact
          such was the group's popularity that in the first week of April, 1964
          they held all top five positions in the Billboard chart with a further
          seven titles it's Hot Hundred. Despite their success, their workload
          did not ease up, in fact within hours of returning from a triumphant
          visit to the US, which had included concert performances and three
          appearances on the Ed Sullivan TV show, the guys were in a TV studio
          in London rehearsing and recording another guest appearance. The
          Spring and early Summer of 1964 saw The Beatles filming and recording
          new material both for the movie and their next album. They also filmed
          a TV special, and played a few UK dates prior to jetting off on a 27
          day tour that visited Denmark, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia
          and New Zealand. They eventually returned to Britain on 2nd July and
          four days later attended the world premiere of "A Hard Day's Night" at
          the London Pavilion. The album reached no.1 in the UK charts towards
          the end of July and occupied the top spot for 21 of the 38 weeks that
          it spent in the Top Twenty. n the USA, A different album was issued to
          that at home. The US version (issued in late June) was a soundtrack
          which as well as featuring a number of the songs from the UK album
          also included four instrumental pieces from the film's soundtrack
          performed by George Martin's Orchestra. A month later Capitol Records
          released "Something New" an all-Beatles album that included eight
          songs from the UK release along with a further three tracks not
          previously released in the US. Both albums achieved enormous success.
          The soundtrack album enjoyed a 14-week stay at #1 and despite the
          crossover of titles, "Something New" spent nine of those same weeks at
          #2.
