          The Beatles' seventh album was released in early August 1966.
          Following the release of Rubber Soul the group had embarked on what
          was to be their final UK concert tour and following a lengthy break,
          they returned to Abbey Road to record continually for three months.
          The first recordings released from these sessions, engineered by Geoff
          Emerick, was the single "Paperback Writer" and "Rain" and those tracks
          gave an indication of what was to come. Having longer in the studio
          had paid off with greater creativity and experimentation and with John
          and Paul in fine form as writers. George also made his mark with three
          of his compositions appearing on a Beatles album for the first time.
          Prior to the album's release, the band had set off on a short tour of
          Western Germany, prior to flying to Japan then the Philippines and
          finally to the USA for what turned out to be their final gigs, the
          last of which took place on 29thAugust 1966 at Candlestick Park, San
          Francisco The distinctive album sleeve design was the work of Klaus
          Voormann, an old friend from their Hamburg Days. The album entered the
          UK chart at no. 1 where it enjoyed seven weeks in that spot out of an
          impressive overall run of 34 weeks.
