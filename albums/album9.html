          The Beatles devised, wrote and directed a television film called
          Magical Mystery Tour which was broadcast on BBC Television at
          Christmas, 1967 Even before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had
          hit the shops, the idea of the programme had been born and work had
          commenced on the title track.It was decided that the soundtrack for
          the programme would be released on two seven inch discs which would be
          packaged with a booklet in a gatefold sleeve. The booklet contained
          stills from the show along with a comic strip telling the story. A
          lyric sheet was also stapled into the centrespread of the booklet. The
          EP was a runaway success and reached no. 2 in the UK singles chart,
          held off the top spot by their own single... "Hello, Goodbye". In the
          US, the double-EP format was not considered viable so instead, Capitol
          Records created an album by placing the six songs from the EP on side
          one of an album and drawing side two from the titles that had appeared
          on singles in 1967. These titles were "Strawberry Fields Forever",
          "Penny Lane", "All You Need Is Love" - their anthem that had been
          broadcast around the world via Satellite in June. "Baby, You're A Rich
          Man" and their current single, "Hello, Goodbye". The US release made #
          1 in early January 1968 and stayed there for eight weeks. Its initial
          chart run lasted 59 weeks.1967 had certainly been a year of great
          achievement but it was also tinged with sadness. Brian Epstein, The
          Beatles' manager since 1961 passed away on 27th August, 1967 at the
          age of 32.
