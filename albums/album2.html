        <p>
          Friday 22nd November, 1963 is still remembered by many, who lived
          through it as the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated
          in Dallas, Texas. Earlier on that eventful day, Parlophone had
          released the Beatles' second album. With The Beatles carried on where
          Please Please Me had left off, melding more Lennon-McCartney originals
          with further highlights from their stage set. It also included the
          song-writing debut of their twenty-year old, Lead Guitarist, George
          Harrison. While the majority of their debut album had been completed
          in one day, The Beatles had to record their second release in-between
          other engagements that included, concert tours, numerous radio and TV
          performances (including the prestigious Sunday Night At The London
          Palladium) and their first international tour to Sweden. It was around
          this time that the term "Beatlemania" was first coined and this was
          very much in evidence when they took part in that year's Royal Variety
          Performance in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, The Queen
          Mother and Princess Margaret. If that wasn't enough they also had to
          write, record and promote three new 45's all of which reached the no.1
          spot in the UK charts. None of the tracks from With The Beatles was
          released as a single in the UK and the distinctive black and white
          cover shot by Robert Freeman also broke new ground for a pop album.
          With The Beatles shot to No. 1 in the Britain replacing Please Please
          Me and remained there for 21 of the 51 weeks it spent in the Top
          Twenty. Like Please Please Me it didn't receive a US release until
          1987 but the cover shot was used on their debut album for Capitol
          Records "Meet The Beatles" - which also included nine of the tracks
          from the British release plus three other songs including their first
          US hit - "I Want To Hold Your Hand".
